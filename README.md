# Reading Notes

This repository contains my reading notes from books during my PhD journey.  
The notes are organized by book and chapter, focusing on key concepts, summaries, and reflections.  

## Purpose
- 📚 Record important ideas from books I have studied  
- 📝 Organize knowledge in a structured and searchable way  
- 🎯 Track progress and build long-term understanding  

## Structure
- **Book_Title/** — each book has its own folder  
  - **Chapter Notes/** — notes for each chapter  
  - **Summaries/** — concise summaries and takeaways  
  - **References/** — bibliographic details of the book  

## Usage
These notes are mainly for personal study and reference, but may also be helpful to anyone exploring similar topics.
